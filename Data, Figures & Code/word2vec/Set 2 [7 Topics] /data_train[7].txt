You look so tan and healthy ! Thanks. I just got back from summer camp.  How was it ? Great. I got to try so many things for the first time . Like what ? I went sailing , fishing, and horseback riding. I'm so jealous. The counselors were so nice too. It was the best summer ever. Except for all those mosquitoes!
